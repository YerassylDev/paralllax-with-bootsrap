		<h1 class="display-2">Our Vision</h1><br>
		<p>We envision a world that works well. Where many disparate parts come together with energy, synergy, and synchronicity to form a more valuable, more connected, more innovative, and more rewarding whole.</p><br>
		<p>We believe that, while we can't create perfection, we can strive for it. While we can't make others accept new ideas, new processes, and new results, we can make it possible for people to see the benefits with greater clarity.</p><br>
		<p>We work, every day, toward making our vision a reality by never forgetting what it is, by keeping our mission and our values central to our core bellefs and work, and by remaining positive that we live in a world where ideas and people can, should, and must make a difference</p><br><br>

		<h1 class="display-2">Our Mission</h1><br>
		<p>Our mission is to change the world, and to help our clients change it. That's why "Change the world." is the default screen saver on Parallax computers. Whyit's the large sculpture in the entryway of each of our offices. And why it's the theme line we use in all of our communications.</p><br>
		<p>We know change is the new constant; it's all around us and dealing with it is challenging. We therefore strive to make it easier for our clients, partners and workforce to learn how to use various perspectives in observing, understanding and addressing it. Our way is not the only wayWe recognize and respect different approaches to the same challenge.</p><br><br>

		<h1 class="display-2">Our Values</h1><br>
		<p>We accomplish our mission and fulfill our vision by adhering to our core values:</p><br>
